More detailed at: https://github.com/gsilos/YamlWebEditor (the source code).
This is a Docker project, the code used Python2. Because Python2.7 is quite obsolete, if you want to try the project, you should modify the Dockerfile, or you can replace the Dockerfile by Dockerfile_for_Python2.7 located in the Dockerfile_for_Python2.7_original_project directory.
